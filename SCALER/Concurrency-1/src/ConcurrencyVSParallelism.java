public class ConcurrencyVSParallelism {
    /* Concurrency :- Concurrency means a system can have multiple
    threads in different stages of execution at the same time but
    not necessarily making progress at the same time.
    That means a core can handle multiple threads but executes
    only one at a time
    Parallelism :- Parallelism means in a multiple core CPU, there are
    multiple cores, so we can expect multiple tasks executing at the same time,
    so actually as many number of cores are there in CPU that many number of
    threads can be running simultaneously.
