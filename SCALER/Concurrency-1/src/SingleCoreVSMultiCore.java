public class SingleCoreVSMultiCore {
    /* Core :-
    A core is the actual execution unit of a processor which executes
    the tasks given by operating system and the speed of a CPU is in
    GHz around 2.5 GHz means 2.5 x 10^9 operations per second and that
    is too fast and a core can execute one thread at a time but due to
    such high speed it keeps switching after one task executes it immediately
    switches to next thread so even there are 1000s of thread running in a
    process, but a core executes one thread at a time and one core can
    manage multiple threads but execute one at a time.
    Single core vs Multi core :-
    The line itself states that a single core have single core and a multicore
    CPU have more than one cores like dual-core, quad-core, octa-core and as many
    cores are there in a CPU, that many number of tasks can be executed at a time
    but if number of threads in application is high then java application might crash,
    so we should use threads wisely.
