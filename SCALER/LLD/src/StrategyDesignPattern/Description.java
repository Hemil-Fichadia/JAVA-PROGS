        /* Strategy is a behavioural design pattern.
        Behavioural means action/method centric or how to implement methods in our codebase.

        Let's consider a use-case for it, in Google Maps when we select current location and destination
        to reach then we go for directions and just after that we have some options in front of us
        with estimated time to reach destination and that varies with the mode of transport we choose
        like by walk, by cycle, by bike and by train, so this is effective as there can be some narrow
        roads that can only be crossed by taking a walk or by a cycle, in this case if someone is
        travelling by car so maps can search for some alternate route for destination.
