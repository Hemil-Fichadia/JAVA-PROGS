        Step - 2 : Gather the requirements
        After steps 1 & 2, one would be able to understand the system and then will proceed
        towards next steps
        Step - 3 : Class diagram
        Step - 4 : Schema design

        1) For each class in the class diagram, create its table for database
        2) For each primitive attribute, create a column as it is.
        3) For non-primitive attributes, find the cardinality and apply corresponding rule.

        1) Project Structure :- For every category of class should be included to different package.
        2) At least one functionality should be working end to end.
            #) first of all code all the models
            #) Start implementing requirements in sequence
        3) Then code the first UserController, UserService, UserRepository
